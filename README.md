# Deep-learning-Art-Neural-style-Transfer
Result:

Implement the neural style transfer algorithm
Generate novel artistic images using your algorithm


Problem Statement:


Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, it merges two images, namely: a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G).

The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.







warning:
I did this project from my courses in coursera.org so if you have this project now please dont check the codes it is so important to think about them
